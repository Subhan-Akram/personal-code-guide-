React Notes :

Concurrency is a foundational update to Reactâ€™s rendering mechanism. 
Concurrency allows React to interrupt rendering.

React 18 introduces the foundation of concurrent rendering and 
new features such as suspense, streaming server rendering, and 
transitions are powered by concurrent rendering.


1) Batching  
 
 React re render at end
 if function (){
 setstate()
 setrof()
 
 re-render here,React handlke it autmoatically but if in any case you need 
  ,you can use this flushSync
 }
 
 2)Transitions
 Transitions can be used to mark UI updates that do not need urgent resources for updating.
 
 import { startTransition } from 'react';

// Urgent: Show what was typed
setInputValue(input);

// Mark any non-urgent state updates inside as transitions
startTransition(() => {
  // Transition: Show the results
  setSearchQuery(input);
});


Suspense:

we can use ,if any componenet take lonhger time to load so we can use 
this while other application will be load and working and when it will become
ready so you can intereact with it .
